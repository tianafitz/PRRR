An important step in many scRNA-seq analysis pipelines is the classification of cells into known cell-types. While this can be achieved using experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, these approaches are impractical for large numbers of cells. This motivates the development of data-driven cell-type identification methods. We find limitations with current approaches due to the reliance on known marker genes and sensitivity to the quality of reference samples. Here we present a computationally light statistical approach, based on Naive Bayes, that leverages public datasets to combine information across thousands of genes and probabilistically assign cell-type identity. Using datasets ranging across species and tissue types, we demonstrate that our approach is robust to low-quality reference data and produces more accurate cell-type identification than current methods.},

abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have rapidly become a standard method for disease gene discovery. A substantial number of recent GWAS indicate that for most disorders, only a few common variants are implicated and the associated SNPs explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of GWAS results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context. Following a GWAS, association results can be assigned to pathways and tested in aggregate with computational tools and pathway databases. Reviews of published methods with recommendations for their application are provided within the framework for each approach."

	abstract = {In high-dimensional regression problems, often a relatively small subset of the features are relevant for predicting the outcome, and methods that impose sparsity on the solution are popular. When multiple correlated outcomes are available (multitask), reduced rank regression is an effective way to borrow strength and capture latent structures that underlie the data. Our proposal is motivated by the UK Biobank population-based cohort study, where we are faced with large-scale, ultrahigh-dimensional features, and have access to a large number of outcomes (phenotypes): lifestyle measures, biomarkers, and disease outcomes. We are hence led to fit sparse reduced-rank regression models, using computational strategies that allow us to scale to problems of this size. We use an iterative algorithm that alternates between solving the sparse regression problem and solving the reduced rank decomposition. For the sparse regression component, we propose a scalable iterative algorithm based on adaptive screening that leverages the sparsity assumption and enables us to focus on solving much smaller sub-problems. The full solution is reconstructed and tested via an optimality condition to make sure it is a valid solution for the original problem. We further extend the method to cope with practical issues such as the inclusion of confounding variables and imputation of missing values among the phenotypes. Experiments on both synthetic data and the UK Biobank data demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and the algorithm. We present multiSnpnet package, available at http://github.com/junyangq/multiSnpnet that works on top of PLINK2 files, which we anticipate to be a valuable tool for generating polygenic risk scores from human genetic studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{tumorPred,
	Abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the decomposition of complex tissues into functionally distinct cell types. Often, investigators wish to assign cells to cell types through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation or via `mapping'to existing data. However, manual interpretation scales poorly to large datasets, mapping approaches require purified or pre-annotated data and both are prone to batch effects. To overcome these issues, we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell-type marker genes to annotate single-cell RNA sequencing data into predefined or de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while controlling for batch and sample effects. We demonstrate the advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and analysis of tumor microenvironment composition in high-grade serous ovarian cancer and follicular lymphoma.},

@article{scPred,
	Abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the characterization of highly specific cell types in many tissues, as well as both primary and stem cell-derived cell lines. An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an individual cell based on its transcriptional profile. Here, we present scPred, a new generalizable method that is able to provide highly accurate classification of single cells, using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning probability-based prediction method. We apply scPred to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells and show that scPred is able to classify individual cells with high accuracy. The generalized method is available at https://github.com/powellgenomicslab/scPred/.},

author = {Carpenter, Bob and Gelman, Andrew and Hoffman, Matthew D. and Lee, Daniel and Goodrich, Ben and Betancourt, Michael and Brubaker, Marcus and Guo, Jiqiang and Li, Peter and Riddell, Allen},
abstractNote = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can also be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

Existing methods are based on the linear mixed model, with the assumption that the genetic effects are random variables, which is opposite to the fixed effect assumption embedded in the framework of quantitative genetics theory. Moreover, heritability estimators provided by existing methods may have large standard errors, which calls for the development of reliable and accurate methods to estimate heritability.},
